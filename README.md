# Click Time Logger

A simple web application that logs the exact time when a button is clicked and displays it on the page. This project demonstrates basic front-end interaction using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features
- Interactive button that logs click events
- Real-time status updates in the UI
- Clean, responsive design
- Console logging for debugging

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sallenux/docs-as-code-starter.git
   ```
2. **Navigate into the project folder**:
   ```
   cd docs-as-code-starter
   ```
3. **Open the project**:
   - You can open `index.html` directly in your browser or
   - Use a local development server (e.g. VS Code Live Server extension)

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click the **"Click me"** button.
3. View the updated status message showing the click time.
4. Check the browser's developer console (`F12` → Console) to see the logged timestamp.

Example console output:
```
index.html:52 Live reload enabled.
script.js:8 Button clicked at 10:53:39 PM
```
